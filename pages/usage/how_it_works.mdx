The `Laravel Auth Logs` package provides a robust way to log and manage user authentication events in your Laravel application.

This section will guide you through the key features and functionalities of the package, helping you understand how it works and how to utilize it effectively.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Logging**: The package automatically logs user login, logout, and failed login attempts without requiring additional code.

- **Customizable Notifications**: You can configure notification templates for various authentication events, allowing you to tailor the user experience.

- **Geolocation Support**: The package can fetch geolocation information for logged events, providing context about where authentication events occur.

- **Retention Management**: It includes a built-in mechanism to purge old logs based on a specified retention period, helping you manage database size and performance.

## How It Works
### Event Listeners
The package listens for authentication events in Laravel, such as user login, logout, and failed login attempts. When these events occur, the package automatically triggers the appropriate logging functionality.
### Logging Mechanism
When an authentication event is detected, the package creates a new log entry in the specified database table. This entry includes details such as:
- User ID
- Event type (login, logout, failed login)
- Timestamp of the event
- IP address of the user
- Geolocation data (if enabled)
### Notification System
If configured, the package sends notifications to users about significant authentication events, such as logins
from new devices or failed login attempts.
The notification templates can be customized to fit your application's branding and messaging.
### Purging Old Logs
The package includes a retention policy that automatically purges old authentication logs based on the configured retention period.
This helps keep your database clean and optimized.
### Model Integration
To utilize the package, you need to integrate it with your user model by adding the `AuthLogs` trait.
This trait provides methods to access authentication logs and perform related operations, such as checking the last login time or registering a logout event.
### Configuration
The package comes with a configuration file that allows you to customize various aspects of its behavior, including:
- Table name for storing logs
- Date format for notifications
- Geolocation API endpoint
- Database connection settings
### Customization
You can extend the package's functionality by creating custom event listeners or notification templates.
This allows you to tailor the package to your specific application needs.

By leveraging its features, you can enhance security, improve user experience, and maintain a clean and efficient logging system.
