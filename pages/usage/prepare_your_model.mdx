Before using the **Laravel Auth Logs** package, you need to prepare your model to support auth logs functionality.

This section will guide you through the steps required to set up your model.

###  Add the `AuthLogs` Trait
To enable access to the auth logs functionality, you need to add the `AuthLogs` trait to your model.
This trait provides the necessary methods and properties for logging authentication events.

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Models;

use Akira\LaravelAuthLogs\Traits\AuthLogs;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use AuthLogs;

    // Your model code here
}
```
The `AuthLogs` trait will add some methods to your model.

- `authenticationLogs()`: Retrieves the authentication logs for the user.
- `latestAuthentication()`: Retrieves the latest authentication log for the user.
- `notifyAuthenticationLogVia()`: Notifies the user about authentication events.
- `lastLoginAt()`: Retrieves the timestamp of the user's last login.
- `lastSuccessfulLoginAt()`: Retrieves the timestamp of the user's last successful login.
- `lastLoginIp()`: Retrieves the IP address of the user's last login.
- `lastSuccessfulLoginIp()`: Retrieves the IP address of the user's last successful login.
- `previousLoginAt()`: Retrieves the timestamp of the user's previous login.
-`previousLoginIp()`: Retrieves the IP address of the user's previous login.
- `registerLogout()`: Registers a logout event for the user.
- `isNew()`: Checks if the user is new based on the authentication logs.
