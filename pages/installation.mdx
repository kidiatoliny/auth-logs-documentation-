Follow the steps below to seamlessly integrate the **Laravel auth logs** into your Laravel project.

### Pre-Installation Considerations
Before you begin, ensure you consult the [Prerequisites](/prerequisites) page to check for important requirements and considerations.

This step will help you avoid any potential configuration issues during the installation process.

### Check for Existing Configuration Files
If your application already has a `config/auth-logs.php` file, you must **rename** or **remove** it to avoid conflicts.

This package will publish its own default configuration file, which is essential for customizing the package.

### Install the Package via Composer
To install the package, use Composer – the PHP dependency manager.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash copy
composer require akira-io/laravel-auth-logs
```
This command will download and install the package into your Laravel project.

### Publishing the Configuration File and Running Migrations

Once the package is installed via Composer, you can publish the config file and migrations. Run the following command:

```bash copy
php artisan auth-logs:install
php artisan migrate
```

This command will publish the package’s configuration file and migrations to your project, allowing you to customize the followable
settings according to your requirements.

## Default Configuration File

Once the package is installed, you can view the default configuration file contents by visiting the [Config file](/config) section.
In this section, you'll find all the parameters you need to customize, according to your application's requirements.
